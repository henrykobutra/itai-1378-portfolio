# 🖼️ My Awesome Computer Vision Journey! 🤖

Welcome to the digital gallery of my mind-bending adventure through the world of Computer Vision! 🚀

## 🎓 Course Information

This repository contains my work from the Computer Vision course at Houston Community College, taught by the amazing Professor Patricia McManus. Her guidance and expertise have been instrumental in this journey through the pixels and neural networks of computer vision!

## 🕵️‍♂️ What's this all about?

This repo is a treasure trove of my learnings, experiments, and occasional "Aha!" moments from my Computer Vision course. From pixel-pushing to AI-powered image wizardry, it's all here!

## 🎭 What you'll find in this repo

- 📊 Jupyter Notebooks: Where the magic (and occasional confusion) happened
- 🖼️ Image Processing: My attempts at making computers "see" like us
- 🧠 Machine Learning Models: Teaching machines to be as indecisive as humans
- 🏋️ CIFAR-10 Classification: Where I made a computer sweat over chihuahuas and muffins
- 🕹️ TensorFlow Playground: My digital sandbox for neural network shenanigans
- 🔍 Object Detection: Teaching computers to play the most advanced game of "I Spy"

## 🚀 Highlights

- Survived the math behind Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 🧮
- Made a computer recognize a hot dog... most of the time 🌭
- Learned that "computer vision" doesn't mean teaching computers to need glasses 👓

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (my new best friend)
- OpenCV (for when I needed to open my computer's eyes)
- TensorFlow & Keras (for building neural networks and my patience)
- Jupyter Notebooks (where the magic happens, and occasionally breaks)

## 🎓 What I Learned:

"Computer vision is not about teaching computers to see, it's about teaching computers to understand the world around us." - Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA

(And also about teaching myself not to panic when my code doesn't work on the first try... or the tenth)

## 👀 What's Next?

Who knows? Maybe teaching computers to appreciate modern art or to find Waldo faster than I can!

Feel free to explore, laugh at my coding jokes, and maybe learn a thing or two about making computers see the world in all its pixel-perfect glory!

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

A huge thank you to Professor Patricia McManus for her exceptional teaching and for making complex concepts accessible and exciting. This course has truly opened my eyes (pun intended) to the fascinating world of computer vision!

Happy coding, and may your loss functions always converge! 📉😄
