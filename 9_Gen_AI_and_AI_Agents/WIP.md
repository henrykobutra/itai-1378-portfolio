# Capstone Project: Train an AI Agent to Play Flappy Bird

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This project is currently under development and will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned for an exciting journey into the world of AI and game playing!

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, we're diving into the fascinating realm of reinforcement learning and computer vision to train an AI agent to play the popular game Flappy Bird. This project combines cutting-edge AI techniques with classic game mechanics, offering a perfect blend of challenge and fun.

### Objective

To understand and implement the process of training an AI agent to play the Flappy Bird game using computer vision and reinforcement learning.

### Project Paths

This project offers two exciting paths:

1. **Conceptual Path**: A deep dive into the theory and concepts behind training an AI to play Flappy Bird (no coding required).
2. **Coding Path**: Hands-on implementation of the AI agent.

### Key Components

- Environment setup using PyGame Learning Environment (PLE)
- Integration of pre-trained models for feature extraction
- Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms
- Model training and optimization
- Testing and evaluation of the AI agent's performance

## Coming Soon

- Detailed project implementation
- Code snippets and explanations
- Results and performance analysis
- Challenges faced and solutions implemented
- Reflections on the learning experience

## Stay Tuned!

This project represents the culmination of our journey through computer vision and AI. It's an opportunity to apply everything we've learned to a fun and challenging real-world problem. 

Check back soon for updates as we bring our Flappy Bird AI agent to life!
